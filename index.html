    <h1>Falie's hobbies</h1>
  <p>My main hobby is probably <em>listening</em> to music or watching shows on my phone. The main things that I like to listen to is <em><strong>Black veil brides</strong></em>, Paramore, Falling in Reverse, Pierce the veil, flower face, and a lot of other bands. I also really like to watch shows usually on my phone. the main things i like to watch would probably be on Youttube or on Netflix. I do have other hobbies but those are definitely the main two. Second place for hobbies can go to drawing. i only really like doodling on my classwork rather than actually drawing in my journal. I've only ever finished one drawing notebook and it took me like two years I think. But those are some of my main hobbies that I have.</p>
